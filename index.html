        A simple person, well not that simple. A person who has finished all 3 Py courses, and is continuing the 2nd
        level of HTML?
        Who else but me!! Almost 90% of my brain literally concerntrates on cricket. The rest 10% is my own things.
        Didn't understand? In a nutshell,
        I'm saying that I like to do many things which ae listed in all the info. Probably I have a million
        opportunities to become. Just naming some:
        A Software Engineer(help of python and HTML), A Yoga and Meditation teacher(refer to the things listed above), A
        Cricketer!(I love cricket). Just some possible
        things.. But being a person who is almost at the level of Extrodinary, it just isn't enough. I have to still
        keep on discovering my hidden properties/abilities, for example
        I never knew how to write a poem until I wrote one. I also never knew that I can write stories, essays, etc with
        ease! I hope you enjoyed reading about me! Just a shoutout
        to all the new updates coming soon.</p>
