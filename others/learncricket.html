              <h1>Why do I like Cricket?</h1>
              <p>Practically according to me, Cricket enhances the mind's concerntration and tests your agility.
                Plus, my father loves to play cricket, and so do I. Many a time, people think that cricket is all about
                hiting the ball with the bat. But, in reality though, cricket has more than just balls and bats. It tests your agility while running,
                Bowling and batting. What you ae doing here is, playing a game. If you are serious about this, then might enjoy!!
              </p>

              <h1>Main objective of Cricket</h1>
              <p>The main objective of cricket is that make your batting last long and you have a big chance of scoring more runs.
                In a nutshell, it means: DO NOT GET OUT. Try to keep the ball in the control of your bat. One silly or the "I-did-it-by-mistake" type of mistake and you are already
                going direct to the dressing room. Even while bowling, take your concerntration where you want to throw the ball. Or else it might result in some injuries or just wrong bowling.
                And once out, you are out. You never have a second chance here(except for the next match), and even though you make a 100 runs or so, don't let overconfidence get the better of you.
                As I mentioned before, One silly or the "I-did-it-by-mistake" type of mistake and everything's finished. Many players seem to be more aggresive and serious about this game. overconfidence gets
                them, and they are directly to the dressing room. 
              </p>
