  ---------- t has been about 65 million years since the dinosaurs died out, and till this 
day, scientists have been trying to find the cause of the death of dinosaurs. There are 
some convincing theories about this mystery.

Some of the popular theories are:
        1. A big meteorite crashed into Earth, changing the climatic 
        conditions so dramatically that dinosaurs couldn't survive.

        2. Ash and gas spewing from volcanoes suffocated many of the dinosaurs.

        3. Diseases wiped out entire populations of dinosaurs.

        4. Food chain imbalances lead to the starvation of the dinosaurs.

I believe that the 1st condition makes everything clear, as the meteorite might have caused 
caused the other three. Before I go, I'll share some dinosaur facts!

The dinosaur that:
    1) Was the fastest: Deltadromeus could run upto 64.3 km/h in one straight sprint!
    2) Was the largest: Dreadnoughtus was 26 meters(85 feet) long and weighed 65 tons.
    3) Was the smallest: Epidexipteryx hui was only 44.5 cm in length.
    4) Was the heaviest: Argentinosaurus was the heaviest dinosaur weighing 77 tonnes.
