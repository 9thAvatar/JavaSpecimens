        <p>Here at JavaSpecimens, I don't just show my <a href="https://9thavatar.github.io/JavaSpecimens/" class="Homebutton">Homepage</a> but 
        I instead reflect what I have done. So it doesn't mean that I'll just show the main page and I'll 
    say, "That's it." <strong>We don't do that here.</strong> As a matter of fact, I've made this page 
specially to all the people who want to see the advantages of learning HTML. And I know, from all the support I'll get more advanced in making websites 
and apps. And yes, it's all gonna come true.</p>

                <center>This quote means that in order to inspire others, 
                    you first have to learn things yourself, then teach other people and 
                    then after all that, you start <u>inspiring people.</u>
