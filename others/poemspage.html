                        <h1>Farmer Poem</h1>
                        <p>In the hot days,
                                    <br>
                                    A man works in his field,
                                    <br>
                                    Till the humid afternoons.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <p>It is only the pleasant evenings does he rest; in the cool nights does he sleep</p>
                                    <p>He works day and night, not caring about life's plight, who else but 
                                                the hardworking farmer
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>His fruits so sweet, his vegetables so healthy, for this is what he works for, day and night, who else but the
                                    hardworking farmer.</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>There goes summer, here comes winter, where he rests for the coming summers, who else, but the hardworking farmer.</p>
                                    There goes winter, here comes summer again. Working hard in his field of hope, with his heart feeling as if sliding down
                                    a slope.
                                    <br>
                                    <p>He is always filled with support, who else, but the hardworking farmer.</p>

            <p>A person might be known or unknown, but your family members are always known.</p>
            <p>For all the hard work your family does, and even if you are depressed for a slight, your family fills you up with
            delight.</p>
            <p>Whenever you are blue, but your friends have no clue, your family is the one who has you restored, like a blade of a new
            sword.</p>

                    With all the fiery eyes, when the wind comes it says goodbye.
                    <p>Water does a lot of harm, but it never loses it's charm,
</p>                   <p>Providing warmth, giving out flames, more like a fire-breathing dragon, of all the fiery eyes it claims.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Strangely, people's houses get burned down, causing fire-fighters to frown.</p>
                    <p>"I am hungry!" it roars, countinously as it soars.</p>
                    <p>Wood has real danger, as many have not seen this stranger.</p>
                    <p>Lava, being it's brother, destroys cities so much, and doesn't seem to bother!</p>
                    <p>Strange as it is, just a spark is enough, don't pay attention, and you don't know what you will miss!!</p>
