        <dt>What is Astronomy?</dt>
        <dd>Astronomy is the study of everything in the universe beyond Earth's atmosphere. That includes objects we can see with our naked eyes, like the Sun , the Moon , the planets, and the stars . It also includes objects we can only see with telescopes or other instruments, like faraway galaxies and tiny particles.</dd>

        <dt>What is Astrophysics?</dt>
        <dd>Astrophysics is a branch of space science that applies the
            laws of physics and chemistry to explain the birth, life and death
            of stars, planets, galaxies, nebulae and other objects in the universe

        <dt> What is an Atom?</dt>
        <dd>An Atom is the smallest unit into which
            matter can be divided without the
            release of eletrically charged particles.
            It is also the smallest unit of matter that has a
            characteristic of a chemical element.

        <dt>What is a Beaker?</dt>
        <dd>In a laboratory equipment, a beaker is generally a
            cylindrical container with a flat bottom. Most also haveout
            a small spout to aid pouring. Beakers are available in a wide range of size,
            from one milliliter up to several liters.

        <dt>What is Biochemistry?</dt>
        <dd>Biochemistry or biological chemistry, is the study of chemical processes
            within and relating to living organisms. A sub-discipline of both chemistry and
            biology, biochemistry may be divided into three fields:
            Structural biology, Enzymology and Metabolism.

        <dt>What is Electrochemistry?</dt>
        <dd>Electrochemistry is the branch of physical chemistry concerned
            with the relationship between electrical potential, as a measurable and quantitive
            phenomenon, and identifiable chemical change, with either electrical potential as an
            outcome of a particular chemical change, or vice versa.
