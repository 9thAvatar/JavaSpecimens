        <h1>The Scramble Project</h1>
        <p>The Scramble project is a dream project that I want to continue when I grow up
            <br>
            Initially the project is a future car project and there are collosal number of Car Companies included.
            <br>
            Want to see some of these companies? Check them out with the links at the end of the page!!
            <br>
            Mostly, cars tody run on Fossil Fuels(Petrol, Gasoline, Diesel etc) but this car which will be available
            <br>
            in the year 2050, has a type of fuel that humanity never thought of: Sound Waves
            <br>
            Yes, you've read it right. Sound Waves can initially make a vehicle run if it has neccessary needs. We introduced the first ever
            <br>
            Petroleum Powered car in 1885.
            <br>
            First ever diesel car in 1933. 
            <br>
            First ever Electric car in 1828.
            <br>
            And now introducing the first ever "Sound Waves powered" car close to year 2034.
            <br>
            <h1>How this system works</h1>
            As this car works on sound waves it needs something to power it. Just simple!
            <br>
            You'll need a speaker system or anything else as long it makes sound without you making any effort.
            <br>
            Connect a type of hollow pipe into the Sound Tank, then at the open end of the pipe and put the speaker system inside it.
            <br>
            If it is a big speaker, no need to worry! The pipe's end will have  closing lids where you can close them just in case dust gets into them and they malfunction
            <br>
            And I said "malfunction" because the pipe will have it's own system!! Close the open end of the pipe with the lid,
            <br>
            and then connect your device with the pipe's systems. Play music and done!!
            <br>
            Here, the car's systems focus on the loudness and pitch of the sound. The higher the loudness the higher the fuel capacity. the more the pitch, the more pitch, the more fuel consomption
            <br>
            So just add the loudness to 50% and the pitch to 50% as well and you are ready to go!!
