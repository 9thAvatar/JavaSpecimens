            <h1>What is Yoga?</h1>
            <p>Yoga, Sanskrit for "yoking" or "union", is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines that
            originated in ancient India. Yoga is one of the six orthodox philosophical schools of Hinduism. There are a broad
            variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism and there are four paths or types of
            yoga: Karma yoga, Kriya yoga, Bhakti yoga, and Jnana yoga. Research studies have shown that traditional yoga systems
            that include breathing exercises and asanas or postures, chants, and meditation can reduce stress and improve immunity
            and lung functions. Traditional forms and modern methods of yoga are practiced worldwide.</p>
